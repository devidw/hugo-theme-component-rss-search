= Search

Make your hugo blog searchable by simply search for blog posts in the auto-generated RSS feed file `index.xml`. 

No need to generate extra `.json` search index files.

Since the theme component looks for the RSS feed file, make sure you have it available in your builded site.

== Installation

=== 1. Add submodule

Clone this theme component to your project's `themes` directory:

[source,cmd]
----
git submodule add https://github.com/devidw/hugo-theme-component-search ./themes/hugo-theme-component-search
----


=== 2. Add config

Add this theme component to your list of themes inside your project's `config` file (either `.yaml`, `.toml` or `.json`):

|===
| Format | Syntax

| `config.yaml`
a|
[source,yaml]
----
theme: 
  - "…"
  - "hugo-theme-component-search"
  - "…"
----

| `config.toml`
a| [source,toml]
----
theme = ["…", "hugo-theme-component-search", "…"]
----

| `config.json`
a| [source,json]
----
"theme": ["…", "hugo-theme-component-search", "…"]
----
|===



=== 3. Embed theme component


==== Partial(s)

Include the available theme component partial(s) in your theme's template file(s):

[source,html]
----
<!-- ... -->

{{ if templates.Exists "partials/vendor/devidw/search/include.html" }}
    {{ partial "vendor/devidw/search/include.html" . }}
{{ end }}

<!-- ... -->
----


== Examples

=== Standalone search page

You can embed the partial everywhere you want in to appear on your site.

If you want to have a standalone search page, you can create a page template for your search page. 

To do so, create a `search/single.html` template file in your theme's `layouts/` directory.

NOTE: `search` can be any name you want.

Inside the template file, include the partial as mentioned above.

You propably want to wrap the partial inside a block definition block to extend your main layout:

[source,html]
----
{{define "main"}}
  {{ if templates.Exists "partials/vendor/devidw/search/include.html" }}
    {{ partial "vendor/devidw/search/include.html" . }}
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
----

NOTE: Make sure to adjust the block name to your needs, if you main block is not named `main`.

When you have set up the template file, you can create the actual search page by creating a `search.adoc` file in your `content/` directory.

NOTE: `search.adoc` can be any valid hugo content file name. For example, `search.md` or `search.html` are just fine as well.

Add the following frontmatter to your `search.adoc` file:

[source,yaml]
----
title: "Search"
description: "Quickly find what you are looking for."
type: "search"
# ...
----

NOTE: The `type` frontmatter is important. It is used to determine the page type. Any other frontmatter can be specified as you wish.

You should now have a standalone search page accessible under the address based on your permalink settings.
